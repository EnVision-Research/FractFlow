    "realism_and_3d_geometric_consistency": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The scene has a consistent geometric perspective and textures that mimic real-world materials. However, the lighting seems flat, and there's a lack of shadows which detracts from the realism."
    },
    "functionality_and_activity_based_alignment": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The furniture is arranged in a way that suggests a bedroom with a work area, but there's an unclear relationship between elements such as the shelving unit and the rest of the room."
    },
    "layout_and_furniture": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "Furniture is period-specific and matches in style, but the layout seems cramped with the desk very close to the bed and the wardrobe almost touching the bed's footboard."
    },
    "color_scheme_and_material_choices": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The color scheme is limited and doesn't show a lot of variation. The materials are consistent with wooden furniture, but there's a lack of texture detail."
    },
    "overall_aesthetic_and_atmosphere": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The scene has a coherent aesthetic that suggests an antique or traditional setting, but the lack of decor, lighting, and the black background fails to create a fully immersive atmosphere."
