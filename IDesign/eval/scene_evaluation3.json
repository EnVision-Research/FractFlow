      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The objects generally have a consistent 3D geometry, but the scene lacks environmental context, and some shadows and textures seem unrealistic, affecting the perception of depth and space."
    },
    "functionality_and_activity_based_alignment": {
      "grade": 4,
      "comment": "The furniture arrangement does not suggest a clear functional layout for activities such as sleeping, working, or relaxing. The positioning of the desk and the bed seems impractical for daily use."
    },
    "layout_and_furniture": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The placement of furniture is awkward with the bed and desk facing away from what would be the natural light source, a window, which is not depicted. The lack of cohesive layout affects the room's functionality."
    },
    "color_scheme_and_material_choices": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The color scheme is consistent, with wood tones dominating the scene. However, the overall material choices lack variety and texture depth, which could have added to the realism of the scene."
    },
    "overall_aesthetic_and_atmosphere": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The scene has a coherent antique style, but the lack of decorative elements, wall treatments, and a realistic setting diminishes the overall aesthetic and atmospheric quality of the space."
