    "realism_and_3d_geometric_consistency": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The geometry of the objects is consistent, but the scene lacks complexity, and the lighting appears flat, which detracts from the realism. Shadows and textures are present but could be more nuanced to enhance realism."
    },
    "functionality_and_activity_based_alignment": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The functionality of the space is not fully clear; the desk and bed suggest a living and working space, but the placement of the furniture does not facilitate clear activity zones. The absence of a TV or clear leisure area limits the functionality."
    },
    "layout_and_furniture": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The furniture pieces are somewhat mismatched in style, and the layout does not indicate a clear flow or purpose for the space. The arrangement feels random rather than intentional."
    },
    "color_scheme_and_material_choices": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The color scheme is limited and does not show a varied or coherent palette. The materials are not varied enough to give a good indication of texture or comfort."
    },
    "overall_aesthetic_and_atmosphere": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The overall aesthetic lacks cohesion and does not create a clear atmosphere. While the elements present may hint at an attempt for a classic or vintage style, the execution falls short in conveying a specific mood or aesthetic."
