    "realism_and_3d_geometric_consistency": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The scene has a consistent 3D perspective, but the textures and lighting lack the complexity seen in real-world objects, giving a less realistic look."
    },
    "functionality_and_activity_based_alignment": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "While furniture like the bed and desk are appropriately placed for their functions, the absence of certain items like a chair for the desk and clear walking paths reduce practical functionality."
    },
    "layout_and_furniture": {
      "grade": 5,
      "comment": "The furniture is somewhat sparse and arranged without clear intent. The desk lacks a chair, and the shelves seem to float without support, reducing the layout's effectiveness."
    },
    "color_scheme_and_material_choices": {
      "grade": 7,
      "comment": "Materials have consistent color tones, and wood textures are prevalent. However, the scene lacks variety in texture and color, which might have added depth."
    },
    "overall_aesthetic_and_atmosphere": {
      "grade": 6,
      "comment": "The scene has a coherent aesthetic with a traditional feel due to the wood textures, but the atmosphere is hindered by the lack of detailed textures and accessories that would make the space feel lived-in."
